Bellow you can find the configs I'm using for my current OpenSuse system.

This time, it is inspired by _Mad Max: Fury Road_, as you can see by the wallpaper and color pallete. Keep in mind its still an ongoing project (that will probably be deprecated before it is finished xD).

Most of the configs so far have been either created or adapted by me. Shout out to [@sejjy](https://github.com/sejjy) for the [mechabar](https://github.com/sejjy/mechabar).
