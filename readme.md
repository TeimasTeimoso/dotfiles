Bellow you can find the configs I'm using for my current OpenSuse system.


This time it is inspired by _Mad Max: Fury Road_, as you can see by the wallpaper and color pallete. Keep in mind its still an ongoing project.

Most of the configs so far have been either created by me or adapted by me. Shout out to @sejjy for the mechabar (wayland).
