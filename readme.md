# dotfiles

This is just an old config... Will probably delete this branch eventually.

I used to have a configuration for my _WM_. It still exists in the _old-dotfiles_ branch.

Eventually, I grew tired of it and I want to rebuild my new _dotfiles_. Currently, I'm working while doing my _MSc_ thesis therefore I don't have much time (or will) to rebuild it.
I will gradually tweak my configurations.

I'm thinking about using the following software:
- **WM**: BSWPM.
- **Terminal**: Alacritty.
- **Shell**: Oh-my-zsh.
- **Compositor**: Picom.
- **Notifications**: Dunst.
- **Application Menu**: Rofi.
- **Other software**: Spicetify, sxhkd. 


# Command

sudo ./install_dotfiles.sh
